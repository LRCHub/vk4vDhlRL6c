Another day here in the system
My soul is on a plane
Take a shot of whiskey and some
To de-escalate
I need to lighten all this baggage
Cuz life is heavyweight
I'm sick of rolling with the punches
I need to get away
I wanna go, fly
To paradise tonight
*
I wanna go, ride
The first thing on my mind
I need a get get get get getaway
Get out of this mess I made
Set me free
Tropical therapy
Getaway
My spirit is guiding me
To a place
Where demons can't find me
I'm looking for heaven like
Golden gates surrounded by palm trees
I see a new horizon
Holding on to hope
Say goodbye to all my pain
When it's time for me to go
*Repeat
I need a get
I need a get get get get getaway
I need a get get get get getaway
I wanna go, fly
To paradise tonight
I wanna go, ride
The first thing on my mind
I need a get get get get getaway
Get out of this mess I made
Set me free
Tropical therapy
I need a get get get get getaway
Set me free
I need a get get get get getaway
Set me free
I need a get get get get getaway
Set me free
Tropical therapy
Getaway
