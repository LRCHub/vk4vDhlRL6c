[00:14.86] Another day here in the system
[00:17.71] My soul is on a plane
[00:20.75] Take a short of whiskey and some
[00:23.67] To de-escalate
[00:26.75] I need to lighten all this baggage
[00:29.71] Cuz life is heavyweight
[00:32.83] I’m sick of rolling with the punches

[00:44.40] To paradise tonight

[00:50.40] The first thing on my mind
[00:53.21] I need a get get get get getaway
[00:56.60] Get out of this mess I made
[00:59.89] Set me free

[01:10.16] Where demons can’t find me
[01:12.04] I’m looking for heaven like
[01:14.89] Golden gates surrounded by palm trees

[01:29.19] I wanna go, fly
[01:32.48] To paradise tonight
[01:35.11] I wanna go, ride
[01:38.47] The first thing on my mind
